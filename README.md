## ❄️ xBLACKICEx nix-config ❄️

⚠️ **Attention: This nix-config is currently in an unstable state and may have issues. It is recommended not to use it for now.**

## About This Configuration

This nix-config is my personal configuration used to manage and configure NixOS. However, please note that due to my own usage needs and skill level, this configuration may have some issues, so I do not recommend others to use it for now.

## Creation Process

In creating this nix-config, I borrowed ideas and techniques from the following configurations and resources:
#### my config is based on:
- [ryan4yin/nix-config](https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-config/tree/main)
- [MatthiasBenaets/nixos-config](https://github.com/MatthiasBenaets/nixos-config)
- [Misterio77/nix-starter-configs](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs) 

#### a book I read for nixos and flake ect...
- [NixOS and Flakes: A Modular System Configuration Framework](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world)

Thanks to the above resources and assistance, without which this configuration might not have been possible.
