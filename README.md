## About This Configuration

This nix-config is my personal setup for managing and configuring NixOS. However, please note that due to my own needs and skill level, this configuration may have issues, so I advise against using it at this time.

## Creation Process

In crafting this nix-config, I drew inspiration from various sources and configurations, including:

- [ryan4yin/nix-config](https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-config/tree/main)
- [MatthiasBenaets/nixos-config](https://github.com/MatthiasBenaets/nixos-config)
- [Misterio77/nix-starter-configs](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs)
  
Additionally, I found valuable insights in the book:

- [NixOS and Flakes: A Modular System Configuration Framework](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world)

Gratitude is extended to these resources and contributors, without whom this configuration might not have been feasible.
